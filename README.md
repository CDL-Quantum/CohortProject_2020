## Quantum Bootcamp Cohort Project 2020

The 2020 Cohort Project is an online collaboration bringing together founders in a series of open-source challenges.
During the four-week bootcamp, founders will form teams to compete and collaborate on a set of challenges 
designed to engage science, technology, and business founders in problems related to quantum entrepreneurship.
This year's challenges will focus on Quantum Chemistry.

Goals: 
* Technical: To calculate low-energy quantum properties of some small molecules, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various modern approaches.
* Business: To disseminate the results of the collaboration in an open access format accessible to all quantum entrepreneurs; to identify value propositions in the various technical approaches.

Project Legacy:

Each week your team will fork this repository to your own GitHub account to work on the challenges.  At the end of the week you will issue a pull request. CDL will choose one team's work to merge into the main upstream repository, where it will become part of the legacy of the 2020 Boot Camp.

### 2020 Challenges
Four separate challenges will be issued; one per week.  

* Week 1: Reconstructing a quantum state from data using Machine Learning
* Week 2: Preparing an electronic structure groundstate on quantum hardware.
* Week 3: Studying molecular rotational and vibronic properties.
* Week 4: Solving molecular chemistry using quantum and classical annealing.

### Resources include 
* Data for use in machine learning reconstruction techniques
* Quantum-inspired classical simulation techniques
* Quantum hardware including circut-based computers, CV devices, and quantum annealers
